# Minimax-Checkers-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning-

Welcome to minimax checkers! For this project, we created a digital checkers board using a 32x32 LED matrix and an Arduino Mega. We first developed a player vs player gamemode by creating the basic checkers board environment on the LED matrix. Then, for the player vs computer gamemode, we developed a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning in order to generate the CPUâ€™s moves in C++. Communication between an auxiliary device, such as a laptop, and the Arduino Mega is mandatory since the Mega does not have enough memory to run the minimax algorithm.
